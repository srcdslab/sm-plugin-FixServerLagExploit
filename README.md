# FixServerLagExploit

Another denial of service exploit has been released to the public.
This one is being referred to as the "ping raiser" , "high ping" or "ping increaser" exploit.
I'm unsure if it affects all source engine games or just csgo at the moment.

## Installation
Just put the attached `fixserverlagexploit.games.txt` file inside your `csgo\addons\gamedata\` folder and install the `smx` in the `plugins` folder.
Load the plugin manually with `sm_rcon sm plugins load FixServerLagExploit` or restart your server for it to auto load.

## Warning
This plugin is written differently then most. It's just raw assembly instruction replacement. This means it can easily break and lead to crashing after server updates.
If you are using this plugin and your server starts crashing, start your debugging efforts by removing this plugin.

## Note
Three more server lagger exploits were released today along side this one. This is the most prevalent one though. I'll release more patches if they start to become an issue.

This plugin is mostly untested, let me know if you run into any issues while running it.
